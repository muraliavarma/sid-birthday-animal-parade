# Sid's Birthday App - Refactored Structure

## Overview
The app has been refactored to improve maintainability while preserving all original functionality. The refactoring focuses on:

1. **Component Separation**: Breaking down large components into smaller, focused components
2. **Custom Hooks**: Extracting state management logic into reusable hooks
3. **Type Safety**: Adding proper TypeScript interfaces
4. **Constants**: Moving configuration data to separate files
5. **Better Organization**: Clear separation of concerns

## New File Structure

### Types (`src/app/types/`)
- `index.ts` - All TypeScript interfaces used throughout the app

### Hooks (`src/app/hooks/`)
- `useWindowDimensions.ts` - Manages window resize events
- `useGameState.ts` - Manages game state (candles, balloons, confetti)
- `usePuzzle.ts` - Manages puzzle state and drag-and-drop logic

### Constants (`src/app/constants/`)
- `puzzleConfigs.ts` - Puzzle configuration data

### Components (`src/app/components/`)

#### Home Screen Components
- `HomeScreen.tsx` - Main home screen component
- `FloatingAnimals.tsx` - Animated floating animals
- `TwinklingStars.tsx` - Twinkling star animations
- `Balloon.tsx` - Interactive balloon component
- `Candle.tsx` - Interactive candle component
- `BirthdayCake.tsx` - Birthday cake with candles
- `StartGameButton.tsx` - Start game button
- `Confetti.tsx` - Confetti animation component

#### Game Screen Components
- `GameScreen.tsx` - Main game screen component
- `GenericPuzzle.tsx` - Main puzzle component (refactored)
- `PuzzlePiece.tsx` - Draggable puzzle piece
- `PuzzleArea.tsx` - Droppable puzzle area
- `PuzzleSelector.tsx` - Puzzle type selector
- `CompletionModal.tsx` - Puzzle completion modal

## Key Improvements

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- Each component has a single responsibility
- State management is separated from UI components
- Configuration is separated from logic

### 2. Reusability
- Components can be easily reused across different parts of the app
- Hooks can be shared between components
- Types are centralized and reusable

### 3. Maintainability
- Smaller, focused components are easier to understand and modify
- Clear interfaces make it easier to understand component contracts
- Custom hooks encapsulate complex logic

### 4. Type Safety
- All components have proper TypeScript interfaces
- Props are well-defined and type-safe
- Better IDE support and error catching

### 5. Testing
- Smaller components are easier to test in isolation
- Custom hooks can be tested independently
- Clear interfaces make mocking easier

## Usage Examples

### Using Custom Hooks
```typescript
import { useGameState, useWindowDimensions } from './hooks';

function MyComponent() {
  const dimensions = useWindowDimensions();
  const { gameStarted, handleStartGame } = useGameState();
  // ...
}
```

### Using Components
```typescript
import { HomeScreen, GameScreen } from './components';

function App() {
  if (!gameStarted) {
    return <HomeScreen {...props} />;
  }
  return <GameScreen {...props} />;
}
```

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Easier Debugging**: Smaller components make it easier to identify issues
2. **Better Performance**: Components can be optimized individually
3. **Easier Testing**: Each component can be tested in isolation
4. **Better Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different components
5. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes to one component don't affect others
6. **Better Code Reuse**: Components and hooks can be reused across the app

## Migration Notes

- All original functionality is preserved
- No breaking changes to the user experience
- The app maintains the same visual appearance and behavior
- All animations and interactions work exactly as before
